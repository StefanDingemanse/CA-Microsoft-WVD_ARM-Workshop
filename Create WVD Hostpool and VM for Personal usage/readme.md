# Create WVD Workspace, Hostpool and VMs from the ARM Template

In this step, we will create a WVD Workspace, Hostpool & VMs within our Windows Virtual Desktop subscription for Pooled usage as we did in the previous step, but this time using the ARM Template. The task include:

* Create a WVD Workspace
* Create a WVD Hostpool
* Create VMs in the Azure subscription.
* Join the VMs to the Active Directory domain.
* Register the VMs with the Windows Virtual Desktop service.

We will perform these tasks by using the **Microsoft ARM Template**.
