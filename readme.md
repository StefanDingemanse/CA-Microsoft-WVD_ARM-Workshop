# Welcome to the Microsoft & Cloud-Architect WVD Workshop

These are the Hands-on Lab steps, part of the *Microsoft & Cloud-Architect WVD ARM (Spring update) Workshop*.<br/>
If you have any questions, just ask **Micha** or **Bart** for further assistance<br/>

## Slides
You can find the slides from the Presentation <a href="/CA-Microsoft-WVD_ARM-Workshop/Presentation/MSFT%20Workshop%20-%20Windows%20Virtual%20Desktop.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>

## Considerations

Before you begin, you have to determine the Azure AD Tenant & Windows AD setup for this lab.<br/>
 - **Scenario A)** is that you have a new or empty Azure AD Tenant, with an empty Azure Subscription, **without any pre-configured AD Connect** (Recommended)
 - **Scenario B)** is that you have an existing Azure AD Tenant, with a existing Azure Subscription & already have Azure AD Connect enabled. (Azure AD Domain services is not covered in this workshop but possible)

 > **IMPORTANT**<br/>
 > Please do not perform these steps in a Production environment. An Test environment is really recommended.<br/>
 > If you have to run this workshop in a Production environment, make sure not to remove or overwrite any existing objects in your environment.

 > **IMPORTANT**<br/>
 > If you share an Azure AD Tenant & Subscription with multiple Workshop attendees, make sure only 1 of you perform the PreReq tasks<br/>
 > The others need to wait until the PreReqs are completed before proceeding.
